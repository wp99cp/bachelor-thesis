### Fmask 4.0

Opensource and available ong [github.com/gersl/fmask](https://github.com/gersl/fmask).

### S2Cloudless

Opensource and available
on [github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector).

is based on gradient boosting algorithm. The model was trained on a large training dataset with global coverage.

It can be executed at any resolution

uses 10 bands: B01, B02, B04, B05, B08, B8A, B09, B10, B11, B12
