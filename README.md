# Deep Learning for Accurate Snow and Cloud Segmentation in Alpine Landscapes

This repository contains the source code for my bachelor thesis.
The documentation can be found in the `docs` directory. To view the documentation as a webpage,
run the following command inside the `docs` directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run docs:dev
```

(Note that assumes you have `npm` installed on your system.)

As an alternative the Markdown documentation can be viewed on GitHub directly, although the formatting is not as nice
and links may not work as expected. You find the files
[here: ./docs/docs](./docs/docs).

## Report and LaTeX-Source files

The final report and the source files of the report can be found in the sub-repository `bachelor-thesis-overleaf`.
